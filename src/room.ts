// Two things happen at once and they are not the same thing. LiveKit carries the audio and the
// typed lines — the room the visitor joins with a ticket the tenant's own server minted, so the
// org's key never reaches a browser. The call's LOG, read straight from the gateway with the token
// minted beside that ticket for that one call, carries what the agent is actually doing: the turns, every tool it called and what came back, its declared state.
// The log is folded by the protocol's own reducer, so what the page draws is what the console
// draws, from the same bytes. A phone call has no seat at all: the log is the whole of it — and
// when the visitor calls the agent, a code they key on the phone names the call the page follows.
