/** The call's log as one column of rows, in the order things happened: turns and tool runs interleaved. */
//
// The state the protocol folds keeps turns and tool runs in two lists, each in
// its own order, joined by the `speech_id` of the reply they belong to: a tool
// with speech id X ran while the agent was working on reply X, so it goes ABOVE
// the agent's turn and below the visitor's. Drawing the two lists one after the
// other instead — every word, then every tool — is a timeline that never
// happened, and the whole point of showing this is that it is the real one.
